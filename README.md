EthTracer is a web app that enables Ethereum wallet transaction and balance tracing. The app has an HTML interface for client interaction.

A client can request a list of all transactions for a particular wallet since a specified block (empty field means since genesis) or a wallet balance at midnight of a specified date. Both operations can be done for ether or ECR-20 and ECR-721 tokens.

Revel framework and etherscan.io API were used to develop the app.
